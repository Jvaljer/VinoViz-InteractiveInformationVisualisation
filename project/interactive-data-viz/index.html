            What the Visualizations Show?
          </p>
          <p class="explanation">
            The visualizations primarily illustrate data on alcohol abuse and dependence. 
            The height of the 3D bars represents the number of cases, while their color 
            indicates the percentage of each age group among all cases. Additionally, the size 
            of the circles reflects the death rate from alcohol-related diseases per 100,000 
            total deaths. To provide further context, we included unit representations of the 
            lifetime drinking rate on top of the 3D bars, showing the percentage of people who 
            have ever consumed alcohol. This highlights a trend where younger individuals are 
            more likely to have drinking experience compared to older generations.

            Who Is This Visualization For?
          </p>
          <p class="explanation">
            This visualization is primarily aimed at university students in Korea, highlighting the dangers of 
            alcohol consumption. It emphasizes that alcohol dependence and abuse are particularly prominent 
            in their age group. While the death rate from alcohol-related diseases may be low for young adults, 
            the data shows that it worsens with age. Additionally, the visualization reveals that younger 
            generations are more accepting of alcohol consumption compared to previous ones, suggesting 
            that future alcohol-related issues could become even more severe.

            Why Should You Care?
          </p>
          <p class="explanation">
            The immediate effects of alcohol abuse and dependence are already concerning, impacting physical health, 
            mental well-being, and daily life. Beyond the short-term risks, excessive drinking can lead to severe 
            alcohol-related diseases in the future. Understanding these dangers now can help prevent long-term health 
            consequences and promote healthier choices.

          <p class="explanation" id="alcohol-abuse-answer" style="display:none">
            Alcohol abuse refers to a pattern of drinking that leads to negative consequences, 
            such as failure to fulfill responsibilities, risky behaviors, legal issues, 
            or problems in relationships. It does not necessarily involve physical dependence 
            but can still have serious effects on a personâ€™s health and well-being.

          <p class="title" id="alcohol-dependence-question">What is alcohol dependence?</p>
          <p class="explanation" id="alcohol-dependence-answer">
            Alcohol dependence, also known as alcoholism, is a chronic condition where a person 
            has a strong craving for alcohol, struggles to control their drinking, and 
            experiences withdrawal symptoms when they stop. It often involves both physical and 
            psychological addiction, making it difficult for the person to function without alcohol.
