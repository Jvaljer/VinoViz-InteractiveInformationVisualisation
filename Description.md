# Short Description ...
**Team:** Vinoviz - Jihyun PARK & Abel HENRY-LAPASSAT

**Research Question:** "How does the evolution of drinking habit and alcohol-related issues among 20-50 years old in Korea impact their health outcomes ?"

**Short:** Through this visualisation we aim to answer our research question and illustrate the evolution of both alcohol abuse and dependenc over the years (2001, 2006, 2011, 2016) for specific age groups (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s), with potential insights that can foster a better understanding of these topics and issues (death rates, gender rates, ...).

## Why
Because alcohol related issues and diseases are too often normalized and people might not get how those can impact our lives and we also wanted to provide a better overview of how those concerns were relatable for our age groups (as students and teachers).

## How
Through a 3D visualisations (yet barcharts but soon replaced by more original stuff) that allows for either isolated overview (abuse or dependence) or comparison (both at same time), with 3D spheres to indicate the death rates and give further informations.
Later on we plan to implement details & insights through Hover & Click interactions.
